# iTunes Album Palette 

I loved the idea introduced in iTunes 11 of creating dynamic colour palettes for individual album views dependent on the album art.

This technique could be used to enhance design and UX in a number of circumstances on the web if executed well. 

While this is by no means a comprehensive approach, it provides a proof of concept for the idea. 

## Usage 

Start up a web server, put some images in the `/img` folder and vo√≠la! 

## Future

While I don't intend to perfect this, further improvements for a more complete solution would be:

* Analysing _every_ pixel to determine which colour is actually the most dominant, instead of heavily approximating
* Ensuring there's enough contrast between the background colour and the text color 
* Reduce the amount of browns that the algorithm returns 
* Refactoring the code, because I wrote it a couple of years ago and it's messy. 
* Don't let it return negative RGB values...
