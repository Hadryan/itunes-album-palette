# iTunes Album Palette 

I loved the idea introduced in iTunes 11 of creating dynamic colour palettes for individual album views dependent on the album art.

This technique could be used to enhance design and UX in a number of circumstances on the web if executed well. 

While this is by no means a comprehensive approach, it provides a proof of concept for the idea. 

## Usage 

Start up a web server, put some of your own images in the `/img` folder and vo√≠la! 

I've placed some sample (royalty free) ones in there thanks to the kind folk at [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), [The Pattery Library](http://thepatternlibrary.com) and [Gratisography](http://www.gratisography.com/)! I've tried to sample images where the technique I've used does and doesn't work. 

## Future

While I don't intend to perfect this, further improvements for a more complete solution would be:

* Analysis of _more_ pixels in detail to determine which colour is actually the most dominant, instead of heavily approximating
* Ensuring there's enough contrast between the background colour and the text color 
* Reduce the amount of browns that the algorithm returns 
* Return a secordary color
* Don't let it return negative RGB values...
* Allow uploads
* Clear the cache of palette files 
* Refactoring the code, because I wrote it a couple of years ago and it's messy.
